# coreDNS as a local DNS server
## Configuration
2 files are needed, the Corefile with the basic configuration with the external DNS services we will use and the local domains that we define in the .db file, in this case kubelab.db where all the local domains will be defined. For this lab we will use the fake domain "kubecon.lab". In the files folder you'll find the definition files.

# Demo 1: Edge Image Builder

## Intro
In this demo, we will show how EIB works, explaining the concepts, the structure, and how to use it. In short, EIB allows you to prepare a full stack deployment in an ISO image, enabling the deployment of a fully functional k3s or RKE2 cluster with the ISO without further configuration or internet connectivity. This simplifies the deployment of Kubernetes at the edge or Zero Touch Provisioning workflows like the one used in SUSE ATIP/Edge 3.0 leveraging CAPI and Metal3 to deploy on bare metal machines.
